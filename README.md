# jpeg-rust

This is a JPEG decoder, written in Rust.
THe project is purely educational, although I will try to implement support for settings and options that are actually used in the wild.

A walkthough of the JPEG format, as well as this project, is writtein in [my blog](https://mht.technology) as a series.
This (the blog series as well as the implementation) is very much a work in progress.
Feel free to submit issues, be it bugs or feature requests.
